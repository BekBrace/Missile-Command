# Missile Command

## Description

Missile Command was the first game I played on my Atari home computer. 

This is a recreation of the game in Python. Starting with BekBrace/Missile-Command, I will update the game to more closely match the home console port from 1987.

## Story

You are the local Missile Commander for the Missile Intercept Launch Function. 

You are responsible for the safety of millions of citizens in six nearby cities.  Nuclear war has just broken out.  Wave after wave of nuclear warheads have been detected re-entering the atmostphere in your zone of control.

All that stands between the last remaining citizens of your country and a fireball of death are your lightning reflexes and sharp-shooting aim.  

Get ready!
