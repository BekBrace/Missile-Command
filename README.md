# Missile Command

## Description

Missile command was the first game I've ever played in my life.
This was in 1989 on Atari 800XL home computer my father bought the same year.

Atari 当たり [hiragana: アタリ] in Japanese means: 
"Hit" , "strike" or "to be right".

The game was on a cartridge (i'm sure today's kids don't know what is that!), I put it in the slot, and boom the game is on the TV ready to be played.
This is an attempt to recreate the game after 32 years using Python programming language.
This was not easy to recreate and I had to look up a lot of the logic on internet.
